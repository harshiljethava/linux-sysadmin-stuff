Single User Mode Security

This mode allow user to gain root access by interrupting boot process. This can be done by editing grub config file from boot.
Place the S in end of linux line in grub and save the file. This way you will get the root access of the system without entering any password!
Important file for single user mode security
/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service
/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service

After RHEL 7.x all version are coming with default sulogin in both emergency and rescue mode.

ExecStart line contains shell configure in both files (emergency.service and rescue.service)
Changing"/usr/sbin/sulogin" to "/usr/sbin/sushell" will result in single mode security. Mean any user can get the access the root console using emergency and rescue mode.
